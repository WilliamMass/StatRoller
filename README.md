# StatRoller
This project was designed as a way to learn Tkinter and reinforce the principles of object-oriented programming by
doing something interesting, and quickly became the genesis of an open source project to provide an interactive, fillable
character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons or other similar 5E SRD games.

If you have ideas of what you would like to see as this project evolves, please reach out and let me know.
If you would like to contribute to the project, please let me know.
